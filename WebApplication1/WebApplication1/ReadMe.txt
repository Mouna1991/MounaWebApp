You can run the project by clicking on the run button in Visual Studio and going to the URL 
http://localhost:xxxx/Airport/Create

I created a new JSON file for countries and their abbreviation and this can be found in the following 
link: https://api.myjson.com/bins/11x7yp

Some of the airports in the airports drop down list are null since the JSON file I was provided with had 
some null values as airport names
